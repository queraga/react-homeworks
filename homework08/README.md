✅ React Homework 08 – Performance & ESLint Practice

📌 Summary

This project is a small React application built to practice:
• React DevTools Profiler
• ESLint setup and debugging
• Performance analysis of re-renders
• State & effects optimization in functional components

The app allows the user to enter text into an input field, add it to a list, and observe component update behavior via React Profiler.

⚙️ Features
• Controlled input using useState
• Dynamic list update
• Intentional performance issue using useEffect
• Fixing the issue by adjusting effect dependencies
• ESLint integration using Flat Config
• React Profiler used to detect unnecessary re-renders

📚 What I learned
• How to detect excessive re-renders using Profiler
• How dependency arrays in useEffect impact performance
• How to configure and run ESLint with React
• How controlled input updates trigger component commits
• How to compare before/after performance visually
