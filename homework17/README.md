# Theme Toggle App (Material UI + Emotion)

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates **light and dark theme switching** using **Material UI** and **Emotion**.

## 🚀 Features

- Light and Dark theme toggle
- Material UI theming with `createTheme`
- Global styles reset using `CssBaseline`
- Custom styled button using Emotion
- Responsive centered layout
- Icon change depending on the active theme

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- React
- Material UI (MUI)
- Emotion (`@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`)
- MUI Icons

## 🌓 How It Works

    •	The application stores the current theme mode (light or dark) in React state.
    •	Two themes are created using createTheme.
    •	ThemeProvider applies the selected theme globally.
    •	Clicking the Switch Theme button toggles between themes.
    •	The icon and text update dynamically based on the active theme.
