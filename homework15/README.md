React Homework 15 - Memoization (useCallback & useMemo)

Description

This project demonstrates how to optimize a user list filtering feature in React using memoization.
It uses useCallback to memoize the filtering function and useMemo to memoize the filtered result, preventing unnecessary recalculations and re-renders.

Features
• Display a list of users
• Filter users by name (case-insensitive)
• Optimized filtering using:
• useCallback for the filter function
• useMemo for the filtered users list
• Console logs to visualize when filtering and re-rendering occur

Technologies Used
• React
• React Hooks (useState, useCallback, useMemo)
• Vite (for project setup)
