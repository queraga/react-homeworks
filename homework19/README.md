# Ant Design Form App

A small React + Ant Design practice project that demonstrates building a form and displaying submitted data in a card.

## Features

- Ant Design `Form` with two fields: **Name** and **Description**
- Submit button to send the form
- Submitted values are shown below the form inside an Ant Design `Card`

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Ant Design (antd)

## How it works

    •	The form state is stored in React state (useState)
    •	On submit (onFinish), the entered values are saved as submitted data
    •	A Card renders the submitted data under the form
